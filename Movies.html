    <h1>My Top 3 Movies!!!</h1>
    <h2>I've been wathcing watching ever since I breathe! Here are a list of my top 3 movies of all time! I ranked this of how much it pulled me and to how great the story, characters and settings take place.</h2>

    <h3>3. Kill Bill</h3>
    <p>This is one the cringiest, most fake, old school kung-fu fighting. Its almost if I was watching a Bruce Lee movie. The scene that gets me the most is when O-Ren Ishii avenges her mother and fathers killer.
        She looks at the Yakuza body fearlessly and with complete satisfaction. Kill Bill Parts 1 & 2 are together and theres just too much that is important to the story to leave out part one or two. Oh lord! I almost forgot! When The Bride takes on the Crazy 88 was a blood bath we all needed. I wont spoil the whole movie but just keep wathcing to its entirety. O-Ren Ishii and Black Mamba, "The Bride" battle it out. 
    </p>
    <h3>2. Saving Private Ryan</h3>
    <p>The war movie that held nothing back and pushed the boundries of what to show on the big screen. It showed what true war was about and gave us an insight on what the word "Brothers" mean.</p>
    <h3>1. Star Wars</h3>
    <p>Episode 1 started it all for me! I know! Your saying it wasnt the original one that started it all but in all reality its where the story actually began. It takes us back and shows how Anakin and Obiwan's relationship was a strong bond. So, much to the point where one cannot live without the other and one cannot kill the other. Episode 3 is by far the greatest one out of all the Star Wars movies! It really set us up for the unforgetable two scenes we will never forget. When Darth Vader rises from the medical bed and when he takes out EVERYONE at the Jedi temple. Specifically, the scene where the children ask him for help stating, " Master Skywalker, there are too many of them. What are we going to do." That scene gives me chills!
        I dont mind wathcing Episode 4,5, and 6 from time to time. Shoot, even Episode 7, 8, and 9 I dont mind re-wathcing. But for whatever reason I just keep watching Episode 3 over, and over, and over and over, and over and over and over again. (Its a sickness i know. Im getting therapy for it).
